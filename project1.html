                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>This automated system accepts soiled food totes, rotates them into an enclosed wash cabinet, executes programmable hot water and chemical wash cycles to thoroughly clean all surfaces, and then returns them to floor level. By eliminating manual lifting and cleaning, the solution alleviates ergonomic strain on sanitation workers and ensures consistent hygiene. It is designed to reduce labour costs and enforce food safety by preventing any part of the tote from contacting the floor.</p>

                <h2>Role</h2>
                <p>As the engineering intern on this project, I led the mechanical and electrical design process while collaborating closely with experienced engineers and manufacturing partners. This work covered material selection, the design of a robust safety‑interlocked door, development of the PLC interface and layout, specification and procurement of pumps, heaters, nozzles and sensors, detailed pump, motor and torsional calculations, piping system architecture and comprehensive cost and return‑on‑investment analyses.</p>

                <h2>Tools Used</h2>
                <p>SolidWorks for detailed 3D modelling and torque analysis; engineering calculations for pump and motor sizing; supplier sourcing and component specification; and cost modelling tools.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="project-section">
                <h2>Outcome / Impact</h2>
                <p>The design eliminates manual handling, improves sanitation by preventing contact between the tote lip and the floor, and significantly cuts cleaning time and labour. Its custom approach offers a cost‑effective alternative to off‑the‑shelf systems that are not optimised for the plant’s mix of tote sizes and cleaning requirements, positioning the facility for higher productivity and consistent quality.</p>
