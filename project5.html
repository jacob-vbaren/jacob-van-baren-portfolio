                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>This ongoing personal project combines mechatronics, computer vision and additive manufacturing. The concept involves a lightweight, 3D‑printed turret equipped with a camera to track moving targets and launch soft projectiles. Beyond its playful theme, the endeavour serves as a proving ground for integrating vision processing and closed‑loop control while deepening my understanding of system integration.</p>

                <h2>Role</h2>
                <p>As the designer, I am modelling the turret structure and gearing in SolidWorks and printing parts on my Bambu P1S. I have selected an ESP32 microcontroller as the heart of the system and am evaluating motor and camera options. In parallel, I am beginning development of the vision‑tracking program using online resources and experimenting with control algorithms to coordinate targeting and firing.</p>

            <div class="project-section">
                <h2>Tools Used</h2>
                <p>Fusion&nbsp;360 and SolidWorks for mechanical design; 3D printing with PLA and PETG; an ESP32 microcontroller; camera modules and image‑processing libraries; and servo or stepper motors for actuation.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="project-section">
                <h2>Objectives &amp; Outlook</h2>
                <p>The turret is intended to reliably detect and track a target and fire a projectile with smooth motion control and safe launching. As development continues, I plan to tune the vision algorithms, refine the mechanical design for improved stability and aesthetics, and expand system capabilities to include additional sensors and feedback loops. This work in progress will ultimately become a showcase project demonstrating my ability to integrate mechanical design, embedded hardware and computer vision.</p>
